Markdown is a light text markup format and a processor to convert that to HTML.
The originator describes it as follows:

[TEST Document](/Test2.md)

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read,
> easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to
> structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

There is another [Python
markdown.py](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/). However, at
least at the time this project was started, markdown2.py was faster (see the
[Performance
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Performance-Notes)) and,
to my knowledge, more correct (see [Testing
Notes](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Testing-Notes)).
That was a while ago though, so you shouldn't discount Python-markdown from
your consideration.
